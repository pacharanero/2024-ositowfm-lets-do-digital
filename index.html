        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">software which releases its source code publicly</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">users are granted some additional rights, governed by the Open Source License</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">it <strong>doesn't</strong> mean it's non-commercial</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">it <strong>doesn't</strong> mean it's free either!</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">it is more transparently secure than commercial software, as we can audit the code

        <h1>procurement hacking</h1>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          procurement is now one of the most prevalent barriers to innovation in the NHS.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          at the last Let's Do Digital conference, almost every presentation mentioned procurement as a blocker to
          progress.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          simple and very reasonable project needs became the subject of lengthy and expensive procurement processes
        </h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          open source can be used to hack your way around procurement
          roadblocks - you can try multiple solutions and see which one works
        </h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">then either manage it using internal IT capability or pay for commercial support

        <h1>agile working</h1>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">everyone keeps talking about how we should be working in a more agile way...</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          but the NHS cannot function in an agile way while we are hamstrung by
          bureaucracy and... procurement
        </h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">agile is all about rapid, iterative experimentation</h4>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">open source is a way to bring back the speed of experimentation</h4>

          medical technology is one of the biggest challenges in medicine
        </h5>
        <h5 class="fragment fade-in">
          monolithic closed approaches have failed spectacularly to meet this huge
          difficult challenge

        <h1>in-house development</h1>
        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          some of the best success stories of NHS IT have been where we have created in-house development

        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          NHS Spine 2, NHS App, COVID app, homebrew EPRs

        <h4 class="fragment fade-in">
          open source is a way to share the cost of development with other organisations, to build exactly what we need
          and not what suppliers <em>want</em> us to have

        </h5>
        <h5 class="fragment fade-in">
          Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be
          wasted on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating
          new problems waiting out there.
        </h5>
        <h5 class="fragment fade-in">
          To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time
          of other hackers is precious â€” so much so that it's almost a moral
          duty for you to share information, solve problems and then give the
          solutions away just so other hackers can solve new problems instead
          of having to perpetually re-address old ones.
